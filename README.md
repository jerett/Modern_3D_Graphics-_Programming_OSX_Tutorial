# Modern_3D_Graphics-_Programming_OSX_Tutorial
##SetUp:
	Unlike the tutorial on Window and Linux baesd on glsdk,we only use glfw3.
    You need to install glfw3 on mac.
    if you have homebrew, type:
    	brew install homebrew/versions/glfw3.
    each chapter has a coresponding tutorial,type:
    	cd "directory"; make.
